CHAPTER 1

- **Digital computer:** A machine that carries out instructions to perform tasks for people.
- **Program:** A sequence of instructions that describe how to perform a specific task.
- **Electronic circuits:** The components within a computer that can recognize and execute a limited set of simple instructions.
- **Machine Language:** The primitive instructions of a computer, forming a language to communicate with the machine.
- **Structured Computer Organization:** An approach to designing computer systems systematically and in an organized manner.

**1.1.1 Languages, Levels, and Virtual Machines**

- **Translation:** The process of replacing each instruction with an equivalent sequence of instructions.
- **L1:** New instructions designed to be more convenient for people.
- **L0:** Built-in machine instructions.
- **Interpretation:** The process of carrying out data input by examining each instruction and executing the equivalent sequence without translation.
- **Interpreter:** The component responsible for carrying out the program's control of the computer.

**1.1.2 Contemporary Multilevel Machines**

- **Device Level:** At this level, designers work with individual transistors, the lowest-level primitives for computer design.
- **Six-Level Computer:** Consisting of levels 0 to 5, with each level having a specific role.
- **Level 5:** Problem-oriented language level, designed for application programmers.
- **Level 4:** Assembly language level that provides a way for people to write programs.
- **Assembler:** The program that performs the translation for level 4.
- **Level 3:** Operating system machine level, a hybrid level with some instructions interpreted by the operating system and others by microprograms.
- **Level 2:** Instruction Set Architecture level (ISA level), describing the machine's instruction set.
- **Microprogramming Level:** A level controlling the operation of the data path.
- **Levels 1-3:** Intended for running interpreters and translators written by system programmers.
- **Level 1:** Microarchitecture Level.
- **Level 0:** Digital Logic Level.
